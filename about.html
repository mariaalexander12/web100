<h1>What is Animal Testing?</h1>
<p>Animal testing, also known as animal experimentation, animal research, and in vivo testing, is the use of non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study.
</p>

<p>Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry.
</p>
</div>


<div class ="subtitle">
<h1>Examples</h1>
<P>An estimated 26 million animals are used every year in the United States for scientific and commercial testing. And around 50- 100 millioin vertebrate animals are used in experiments annually. Animals are used to develop medical treatments, determine the toxicity of medications, check the safety of products destined for human use, and other biomedical, commercial, and health care uses. Research on living animals has been practiced since at least 500 BC.

<h1>Use of Animals</h1>	
	<ul>
		<li>Invertebrate</li>
		<p>Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used in animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. </p>

		<li>Vertebrate</li>
		<p>In the U.S., the numbers of rats and mice used is estimated to be between 20 and 100 million a year.[76] Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils.</p>

		<li>Cats</li>
		<p>Cats are most commonly used in neurological research. 24,221 cats were used in the U.S. in 2013, around half of whom were used in experiments which have the potential to cause "pain and/or distress"</p>

		<li>Dogs</li>
		<p>Dogs are widely used in biomedical research, testing, and educationâ€”particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique).</p>

		<li>Non- human primates</li>
		<p>Non-human primates (NHPs) are used in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of neurology, behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation.</p>

<h1>Ethics</h1>
<P>The moral and ethical questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century.
</P>

<p>A 2015 Gallup poll found that 67% of Americans were "very concerned" or "somewhat concerned" about animals used in research. A Pew poll taken the same year found 50% of American adults opposed the use of animals in research.
